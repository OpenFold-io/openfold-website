## What is OpenFold?

### Mission Statement
OpenFold is a non-profit AI research and development consortium developing free and open-source software tools for biology and drug discovery. Our mission is to bring the most powerful software ever created -- AI systems with the ability to engineer the molecules of life -- to everyone. These tools can be used by academics, biotech and pharmaceutical companies, or students learning to create the medicines of tomorrow, to accelerate basic biological research, and bring new cures to market that would be impossible to discover without AI.

### Structure Prediction
In biology, structure and function are inexorably linked. Understanding the mechanisms of biological systems, their engineering, and how to affect them therefore implies a need to know and understand their structure. The consortium is creating state-of-the-art AI-based protein modeling tools that can predict molecular structures with atomic accuracy, making this level of precision accessible in open source for both research and commercial applications for the first time. Researchers around the world will be able to use, improve, and contribute to this "predictive molecular microscope.‚Äù

### Goals
This work aims to:

- Develop a permissively licensed model competitive with the performance of state-of-the-art models.
- Provide the entire training & inference stack and training datasets under the same permissive license
- Optimize the performance of this model for use on state-of-the-art and widely available GPUs.
